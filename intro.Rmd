# Introduction

Here we perform a brief analysis of the 1M neuron data set from 10X genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.3.0/1M_neurons).
This uses a variety of low-level packages to represent the data on-disk, as well as high-level packages for scRNA-seq data analysis.
The aim is to demonstrate the usefulness of the _beachmat_ API in facilitating high-level analyses from a `HDF5Matrix` object.
